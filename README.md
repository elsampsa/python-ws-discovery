WS-Discovery in Python
======================
This is WS-Discovery implementation for Python 2 & 3. It allows to discover services and to be discovered.

Authors and maintaining
-----------------------
Original version created by L.A. Fernando. Code was then forked and maintained by Andrei Kopats. Python3 port done by Pieter Jordaan. Updated packaging & major refactoring by Petri Savolainen.

Usage
-----

A sample use of the module is shown below:

```python
    from .WSDiscovery import WSDiscovery, QName, Scope

    wsd = WSDiscovery()
    wsd.start()

    ttype = QName("abc", "def")

    ttype1 = QName("namespace", "myTestService")
    
    # Note: some devices scope services using `onvif://` scheme rather than `http://`
    scope1 = Scope("http://myscope")
    ttype2 = QName("namespace", "myOtherTestService_type1")
    scope2 = Scope("http://other_scope")

    xAddr = "localhost:8080/abc"
    wsd.publishService(types=[ttype], scopes=[scope2], xAddrs=[xAddr])

    #ret = wsd.searchServices(scopes=[scope1], timeout=10)
    ret = wsd.searchServices()

    for service in ret:
        print(service.getEPR() + ":" + service.getXAddrs()[0])

    wsd.stop()
```

Development state
-----------------
This is not 100% complete and correct WS-Discovery implementation. It doesn't verify data, received from the network. It may crash, and even may contain security holes. No guarantees.

It works for me, and should work for you. But test it carefully for your use case.
